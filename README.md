Power BI visuals &amp; case study
The Microsoft Power BI visuals project provides high quality data visualizations that you can use to extend Power BI. The project contains almost all the basic visualizations and a case study along with different filters.
In order to create the visuals , I've created a relationship between the dimension tables and the fact table with the cardinality being 1 to many . I've also created some measures which were used in making the Business Intelligence report. Along with this , the most important part that I want to highlight is the use of Query editor which I've used in this entire case study. With the help of query editor , I was able to extract more data that was available from a single column.
Hope you guys like it and I'll be happy to read your comments and suggestions.
